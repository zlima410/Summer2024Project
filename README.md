    Create a basic implementation of inventory management as a console application. The specifications are:
    The user should be presented with a menu containing two options:
        - Inventory Management
        - Shop
    On the Inventory Management screen, users should be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete items in the inventory. Those items should be represented as a class containing the following state:
        - Name
        - Description
        - Price
        - Id
    The inventory system should also keep track of how many of a given item are available. This can be incorporated into your class or stored separately.
    On the Shop screen, the user should be able to place items in their cart, remove items from their cart, and check out with their cart.
    During checkout, the user should receive an itemized receipt including the subtotal, taxes (at 7%), and total of the transaction.
    When shopping, users should not be able to buy more of an item than is available. Further, when a user removes an item from their cart, it should go back into the inventory.
